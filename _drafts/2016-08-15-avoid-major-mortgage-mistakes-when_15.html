This buyer had been in the army and felt that he “hadn’t had a place to call home since.” He was about to close on the property when the lender sent an email requesting more paperwork, pushing the closing back another month.<br /><br />The buyer had sent in his application on time and paid for inspections and appraisals. Unfortunately, the lender never sent the application to underwriting. When the buyer asked why everything took so long, the lender cited staffing issues. Because of this, the buyer didn’t have a home to move into when his lease was up. As the buyer said, this finance company failed. <br /><br />When you buy a home, there are certain things you can do to avoid major mortgage heartbreak like this<b>. First of all, make sure you work with a local, reputable lender.</b> Get recommendations from friends and colleagues. Hire someone who has done many transactions.&nbsp; <br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Work with a local, reputable lender.    </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> <br />Please, don’t search online for lenders and hire one from a different state. They won’t know any appraisers in our area, and that can only lead to headaches. <br /><br />You should also make sure that you have money in the bank to close. That means you should have enough for your down payments and closing costs. Don’t run up any additional debts by purchasing something like a car or furniture between contract and closing; doing so will also cause trouble with your mortgage. <br /><br />Finally, make sure that you call your lender with any questions. Make sure you are pre-approved, not just pre-qualified. <br /><br />If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!</span></span>
