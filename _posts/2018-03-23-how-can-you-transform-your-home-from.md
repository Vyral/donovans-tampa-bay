Welcome back to another episode of “Keeping in Tune With the Market.” Today we’re going to begin a series where we will be talking about how to make your house show like a model home without breaking the bank.

As the sale signs pop up around town, we start to notice all the beautiful houses for sale. The ones with good curb appeal, at least. Having great curb appeal is the best way to make your house look like a model home without breaking the bank. Make sure that these three things are taken care of:


HAVING GREAT CURB APPEAL IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE LOOK GREAT.


**1. Any unkempt shrubbery or stray weeds should be gotten rid of.**

**2. Your lawn should be well-maintained and your walkway clearly visible for potential buyers.**

**3. A front door that’s worthy of your home. Install a new doorknob or add a fresh coat of paint.**

Next time, we’ll be discussing some interior fixes that you can make to help your home show even better. In the meantime, text “Show like a model” to (516) 822-1222 if you want me to send you more tips to help you get your home ready.
