*Are you keeping all of the paperwork you’d need for a home sale? Here’s precisely what you need to have on standby. *

What paperwork should you safeguard for future reference and preparation of your home sale?

The first category of things to hold onto is what I call your Very Important Paperwork: **Your deed, survey, and title search**—the big three.&nbsp;

Additionally, save any certificates of occupancy and permits for any additions or upgrades you made to the property. There’s nothing worse than having to jump through hoops with government agencies down the road because you failed to locate the documents mentioned above.&nbsp;

The second group of paperwork to save is your **home repair records**. It’s always handy to provide documentation detailing the last time your big-ticket items like the HVAC system were serviced or replaced.&nbsp;

The third group is all of **the repair manuals for the working component/appliances of your home.** Just think about how thrilled you’d be if the seller you bought from was thoughtful enough to put together and present a New Homeowner’s Manual with all of the manuals in one place\!&nbsp;

Also, **keep 18 to 24 months of utility bills on hand.** This way, you can give buyers a truer sense of what it costs to run the home.&nbsp;

The last—but certainly not least—group of paperwork you want to have on standby should be **replacement cost estimates for anything that’s nearing the end of its useful life.** For example, even if you don’t want to replace your roof right now, it’s best to get an estimate anyway. This helps a prospective buyer have a more realistic idea of the repair/replacement cost instead of guessing the worst-case scenario in their head.&nbsp;
