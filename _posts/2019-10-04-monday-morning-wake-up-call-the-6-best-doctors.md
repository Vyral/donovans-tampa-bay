Ralph Waldo Emerson had it right when he said, “To laugh often and much; to win the respect of the intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the beauty in others; to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here. This is to have succeeded.”&nbsp;

In short, you need to be in good mental and physical health to lead a happy and successful life. And there are six “doctors” that best help us achieve this: sunlight, rest, exercise, diet, self-confidence, and friends. Abiding by each of these “doctors” is the key to a joyful life.

My challenge for you is to start implementing this concept into your day-to-day life, and then to share this message with someone you love. Even simple tasks like sending hand-written notes to five friends this week can really give you an idea of how impactful these changes can be.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Until next time, make it a great week because you want to and deserve to.<br>&nbsp;
