Happy Money*“Before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save. Before you die, give.” - William A. Ward &nbsp;*[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/k_5vGeBB52U)

**Good Morning\!&nbsp;**

**July is a great time to talk about money since it’s traditionally a vacation month. When you talk about a vacation, do you go wherever you want without worrying about money, or do you choose a trip that you don’t really want, out of fear about spending money. Did you know that studies show that your relationship with money is a reflection of your beliefs about money? Too often, money is a source of fear, stress, anger, and discord in relationships. But money can also bring peace, joy, and contentment. Not just because of what it can buy - but how it can make you feel.**

**Experts say that there are two kinds of money: “Happy Money” and “Unhappy Money.” “Happy money” circulates with affection, warmth, and care. It flows into the lives of those who give and share it freely.**

**“Unhappy money” circulates in fear, anxiety and even despair.&nbsp;**

**To learn how to make&nbsp;*Happy Money*, practice the art of allowing money to flow in and out of your life. It’s the flow of money in and out of your life which creates long-term security. Show your gratitude when receiving money or passing it on to others. You can donate money or give money and gifts to your friends and those in need. You can tip well or pay more for something than it is worth. Rejoice and say “thank you” when you receive money and say “thank you” when you give money. Buy from the people you like and invest in your relationships; they are where your true wealth lies.
