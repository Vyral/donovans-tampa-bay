We’re all given the same 24 hours each day, but where you direct your time is something to think about. In response to some questions I’ve received, today I’m going to discuss **time management and organization** a little further.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

So where do you start? First things first—**you’ll want to get out a pencil and paper and make a list of where your time is currently going.** Make note of your work hours, family commitments, and other activities.&nbsp;

Once this is accomplished, assess the areas where your time is going to waste. This part of the exercise will allow you to pin down the essentials, determine where your time is needlessly going, and find out where you want it to go. &nbsp; &nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

When you’re able to highlight the activities that enrich your life, **jot down when you’re going to devote time to those things or when you’ll be naturally engaged in them.&nbsp;**
{: .present-before-paste}

Take the total number of hours you spend immersed in those activities and add them to the number of hours you sleep each day. Then, **subtract your grand total from 24, which will tell you how many hours you have left over to practice real estate sales.&nbsp;**
{: .present-before-paste}

Whether you have four, six, or 12 hours remaining each week, let me know. **This is where you can begin to make optimal use of those hours and find greater success in your real estate business.&nbsp;**
