Are You FEARLESS? –&nbsp;*“A fearless life requires stretching your limits and pushing past the status quo in thought and action. But every time you do, you push yourself closer to the life you imagine — the one you can achieve.”*&nbsp;Barrie Davenport &nbsp;For more Info -&nbsp;[CLICK HERE*.*](https://liveboldandbloom.com/05/overcoming-fear/how-to-be-fearless-in-everything#:~:text=To%20become%20fearless%2C%20begin%20to%20shake%20up%20your,habits%20and%20keep%20yourself%20slightly%20on%20the%20edge.)

**Good Morning\!&nbsp;**

**We all have times when certain things frighten us, but some people seem to live in a state of fear. Not by choice, but because they don’t know how to break out of the fear cycle. The good news is anyone can defeat fear. The secret weapon is passion, which leads to courage. Becoming passionate about something can compel you to act with courage and thus become "Fearless"\!**

**There is a sense of courage that is built around a passionate mission, which can help you overcome fear or anxieties. &nbsp;Sometimes the mindset of “I can’t do it” can keep us from living the life we always imagined. Fear can be the largest obstacle you face. Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, or fear of ridicule.**

**Fear keeps you safe, but safe is not always where you want to be. Dispel the “fear of failure” by evaluating objectively what you can control. Don’t let the “fear of rejection” stop you from appreciating what you’ve already achieved. Life is a journey, and we can’t have the end result without first enduring the beginning and the middle. Author J.K. Rowling was working on her first book when her mother died. She had just had a baby and was going through a divorce. She struggled with depression. Twelve publishers rejected her manuscript. She felt disheartened. She didn’t yet know that an editor at Bloomsbury loved her book. Rowling understood what facing rejection meant, yet her passion and thus, her fearlessness caused her to press ahead. Today people all over the world read her&nbsp;*Harry Potter*&nbsp;books. Her passion for her story helped her "press on regardless"\!&nbsp; Want some Mindsets and some Actions to take to be Fearless? &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://liveboldandbloom.com/05/overcoming-fear/how-to-be-fearless-in-everything#:~:text=To%20become%20fearless%2C%20begin%20to%20shake%20up%20your,habits%20and%20keep%20yourself%20slightly%20on%20the%20edge.)**

**Something to Think AboutPeople who have a significant impact on others have discovered their passions and drawn energy from them. Consider the significance and impact that your actions could have on someone else. When you follow that call, you’ll find that fear has a much weaker hold on you.&nbsp;*****For Rocky Balboa's Advice:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/LxgU_aepGd0?t=156)***
