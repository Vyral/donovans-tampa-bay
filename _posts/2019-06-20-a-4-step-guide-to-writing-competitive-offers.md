On today’s episode of “You’ve Got Questions, We’ve Got Answers,” we’re covering a very important query: How can buyers write a competitive offer?

There are four main steps you’ll need to take to do this:

**Determine the best price and terms.** Work with your agent to determine the terms and price that will strike a balance between being a good deal for you and the seller.&nbsp;<br><br>**Submit your offer with the seller’s motivations in mind.** When you know what the seller wants, you can play on those desires to make your offer more appealing. One component that is universally appealing is the inclusion of a pre-approval letter.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>**Negotiate your offer.** It’s common for a seller to respond to your offer by countering your price and terms. If this happens, be willing to meet them in the middle so that you can seal the deal.&nbsp;<br><br>**Act quickly.** In a hot market like our current one, you can’t afford to waste time. To win, you’ve got to be ready to strike as soon as you find a home that suits your wants and needs.
