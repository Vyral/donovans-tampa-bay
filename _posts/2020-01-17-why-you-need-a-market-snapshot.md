What is a market snapshot, and why do you need one?

A market snapshot is a customized, real-time MLS update and trend analysis overview. That means this customized report selects homes in your neighborhood and compares the asking prices to the sales prices, as well as days on market. It also provides photos of the most current sold houses, homes for sale, and those under contract. This market snapshot is organized into sections, making it simple to understand. You will receive detailed information that is often unavailable on other real estate websites.

**Here are three reasons why you need a market snapshot:**

**1\. You’re a homeowner.** You want to keep tabs on the value of your home, either because you are thinking of selling in the near future, or you’re staying put and want to watch your “nest egg” grow. Do you check your bank statements to see what’s going on with your bank account? Well, it’s smart to do the same kind of review on your largest investment: your home.&nbsp;

**2\. You are considering buying a home.** You want to keep track of what home values are doing in a particular area or neighborhood in which you’re interested. When you request the buyer version of a market snapshot, you will be an informed consumer when it comes time to buy your home. You could also likely save thousands on your purchase.
